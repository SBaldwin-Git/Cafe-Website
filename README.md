# Cafe Website

Created using:

- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript
- Webpack

# The Odin Project

I created this website as part of The Odin Project Fullstack JavaScript course in order to learn about Webpack and put into practise creating webpages using modules.
My hope is that those that view this page and my other projects as part of this course can get an idea of my programming knowledge. These projects will help to catalogue my own journey into Fullstack JavaScript development.
